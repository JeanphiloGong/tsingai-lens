It plays a crucial role in influencing the mechanical properties and behaviors of these materials, particularly during processes such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM). The characteristics of microstructure can be altered through various techniques, including preheating, which further impacts the material's performance and properties. Understanding microstructure is essential for studying how materials behave, especially in the context of SLM processing, where the precise control of microstructural features can lead to improved material performance and functionality.
