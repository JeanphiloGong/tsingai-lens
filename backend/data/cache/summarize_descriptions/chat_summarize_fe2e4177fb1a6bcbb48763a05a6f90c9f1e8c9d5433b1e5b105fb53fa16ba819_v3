The solution treatment was performed at 1200°C, a critical temperature for assessing the alloy's properties. This specific stage in the processing of Hastelloy X was essential for evaluating the microstructural changes that occur as a result of the treatment.\n\nDuring the solution heat treatment at 1200°C, significant alterations in the microstructure of Hastelloy X were analyzed, which are pivotal for optimizing the alloy's performance in high-temperature applications. These changes are indicative of the alloy's capability to withstand extreme environments, making it a preferred choice in industries such as aerospace and power generation, where durability and resilience are paramount.\n\nThe combined effects of the SLM processing and subsequent heat treatment contribute to enhancing the material properties of Hastelloy X, ensuring its reliability and functionality in demanding operational conditions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 400, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
