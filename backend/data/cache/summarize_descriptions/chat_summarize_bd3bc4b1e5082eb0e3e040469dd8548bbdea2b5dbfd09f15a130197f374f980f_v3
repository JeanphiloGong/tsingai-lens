This particular steel can be effectively processed using Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology, which significantly influences its mechanical properties and enhances its suitability for high-performance tooling components. \n\nThe application of SLM with H13 tool steel involves careful consideration of various parameters, including phase transformations and stress formations that can occur during the manufacturing process. Research indicates that preheating is a critical factor during SLM, as it affects the phase behavior and the consequent mechanical integrity of the final product. The SLM process enables the production of complex geometries that are often difficult to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods, making H13 tool steel an appropriate choice for advanced tooling applications.\n\nOverall, the integration of SLM technology in processing H13 tool steel illustrates its importance in the production of durable and high-performing components, thereby reinforcing its status as a key material in the manufacturing sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
