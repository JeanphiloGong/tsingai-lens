These properties make it particularly suitable for industrial applications that demand durability under high temperature and stress, such as tooling and die-making. H13 is characterized by its transformation between austenite and martensite at approximately 300°C, which significantly influences its microstructure during processing, notably when subjected to selective laser melting (SLM).\n\nIn the context of SLM processing, H13 tool steel is extensively studied for its mechanical properties and the effects of different processing parameters. Research indicates that H13's performance can be affected by preheating temperatures, leading to variations in phase transformation and stress formation throughout the fabrication process. Moreover, specific parameter settings during the SLM method have been established to optimize the density and overall quality of the parts produced from H13.\n\nThe alloy's high-speed steel characteristics add to its versatility in industrial scenarios where resistance to wear and thermal stress is paramount. H13 tool steel is elaborately evaluated for its properties when applied in SLM, which includes its ability to maintain structural integrity and performance under extreme conditions. This material stands out due to its combination of hardness, abrasion resistance, and thermal stability, making it a popular choice for demanding high-temperature applications.\n\nOverall, H13 tool steel is a high-performance alloy that undergoes significant transformations when processed with advanced techniques like selective laser melting. Its durability and strength render it essential for applications requiring reliable tool materials capable of withstanding challenging working environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 314, "prompt_tokens": 497, "total_tokens": 811, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
