One of the materials often utilized in SLM is Hastelloy X, a nickel-based superalloy renowned for its exceptional performance in high-temperature environments. Hastelloy X exhibits remarkable mechanical properties and resistance to oxidation, making it ideal for applications in industries such as aerospace and energy.\n\nRecent research has focused on understanding the behavior of Hastelloy X during the SLM process, particularly in addressing challenges such as cracking, which can significantly impact the integrity and quality of the manufactured components. The application of SLM to Hastelloy X has necessitated extensive investigation into various factors that influence the additive manufacturing process, including the effects of preheating. Preheating is essential in SLM as it can help manage thermal gradients and reduce the likelihood of cracking during the melting and solidification phases.\n\nIt has been established that optimizing the SLM parameters for Hastelloy X, with attention to preheating strategies, can enhance the material's performance by mitigating defects that may arise during processing. The combination of high temperatures and rapid cooling rates inherent in the SLM technique poses specific challenges that researchers are keen to resolve in order to fully harness the potential of Hastelloy X in additive manufacturing applications.\n\nOverall, the exploration of Hastelloy X within the framework of Selective Laser Melting represents a significant advancement in efforts to improve the reliability and efficiency of producing high-performance components for demanding applications, ultimately contributing to innovations in the field of advanced manufacturing technologies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 318, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 548, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
