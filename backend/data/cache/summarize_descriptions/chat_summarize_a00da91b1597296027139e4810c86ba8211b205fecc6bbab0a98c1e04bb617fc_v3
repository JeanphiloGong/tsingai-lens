These alloys are particularly notable for their corrosion resistance, high strength, wear resistance, and biocompatibility. As a result of these characteristics, CoCr alloys are extensively employed in the dental field and other medical applications, where durability and compatibility with biological tissues are of paramount importance.\n\nThe biocompatibility of cobalt-chromium alloys allows them to be used safely in the human body, which is critical in medical devices and dental prosthetics. Their mechanical properties are essential for ensuring long-lasting performance in environments subject to stress and wear. Additionally, the corrosion resistance of CoCr makes it ideal for applications where exposure to bodily fluids or corrosive substances is a concern, helping to prolong the life of implants and other medical devices.\n\nIn summary, CoCr refers to a class of cobalt-chromium alloys valued for their superior mechanical and corrosion-resistant properties, making them indispensable in various sectors, particularly in healthcare where biocompatibility and strength are crucial.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
