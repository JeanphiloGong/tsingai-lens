CoCr is a material that has been extensively researched for its remarkable mechanical properties, making it a popular choice in demanding environments such as dental, biomedical, and aerospace industries. \n\nThe application of SLM to CoCr is significant due to the unique capabilities this method offers. The process of selective laser melting allows for the precise fabrication of complex geometries that are often challenging to achieve with traditional manufacturing techniques. This is particularly important for industries that require intricate designs and custom parts, as SLM enables a high level of design flexibility.\n\nStudies have shown that the mechanical properties of CoCr can be influenced by the parameters used during the SLM process. Factors such as laser power, scan speed, and layer thickness are critical in determining the final characteristics of the CoCr components produced. Consequently, ongoing research focuses on evaluating these relationships to optimize the SLM process for CoCr, ensuring that the material retains its advantageous properties while meeting the specific requirements for various applications.\n\nIn summary, CoCr, when processed through selective laser melting, exhibits superior mechanical properties and the potential for creating highly complex structures, making it a material of choice in progressive industrial settings.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 263, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
