It is predominantly classified as a cold-work tool steel, making it suitable for various manufacturing and machining applications due to its durability under strain. In addition to its cold-work characteristics, H13 tool steel is also utilized as a hot working tool steel, which indicates its versatility in different thermal conditions. \n\nResearch has notably explored the mechanical properties of H13 tool steel when subjected to selective laser melting (SLM) processes, particularly with preheating techniques, which enhance its performance in additive manufacturing settings. This aspect highlights the ongoing innovations and adaptations in the processing of H13 tool steel to meet modern industrial requirements.\n\nMoreover, H13 tool steel is sometimes referred to in the context of high-speed steel, underscoring its reputation for high hardness and significant wear resistance. These properties make it a sought-after material in tool manufacturing, where the demands for precision, longevity, and resilience are paramount.\n\nIn summary, H13 tool steel combines a range of beneficial properties that facilitate its application in both cold and hot working scenarios, including its use in advanced manufacturing techniques. Its robustness against wear and heat ensures that it remains a vital material in various industrial practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 482, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
