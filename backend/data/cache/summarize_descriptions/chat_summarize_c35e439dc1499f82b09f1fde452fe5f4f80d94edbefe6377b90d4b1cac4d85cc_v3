H13 tool steel, known for its excellent hardenability, wear resistance, and high-temperature strength, has been analyzed specifically for its behavior in the context of SLM. This research has focused on understanding the phase transformations that occur in H13 tool steel when subjected to the SLM process, as well as the factors influencing crack formation during fabrication. By utilizing SLM, manufacturers can achieve specific component characteristics that are desirable for various applications, including tooling and manufacturing operations that demand high performance under thermal and mechanical stress. The interplay between SLM and H13 tool steel highlights the potential for improving the manufacturing processes and end-use capabilities of components made from this high-performance material.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
