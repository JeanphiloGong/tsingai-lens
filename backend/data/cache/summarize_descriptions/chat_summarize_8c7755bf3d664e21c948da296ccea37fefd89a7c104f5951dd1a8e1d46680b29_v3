It is noted for its strong strength-to-weight ratio, making it a preferred choice in various industries, including military uses, due to its fatigue resistance and durability.\n\nThe alloy's behavior during selective laser melting (SLM) processes has been a significant focus of research. AL7075 is known to be susceptible to crack formation, especially when processed without preheating. The preheating of the alloy has shown to be a critical factor that significantly alters its microstructure during SLM processing, therefore reducing the risk of microcrack formation. Studies reveal that proper preheating conditions can minimize the cracking effect, allowing for better processing outcomes.\n\nAL7075 has been subject to various investigations concerning its mechanical properties, response to thermal conditions, and behavior during SLM production. While it is acknowledged for its high strength, the potential for microcrack development poses challenges that need to be addressed for successful processing and application. Specifically, the likelihood of cracking increases when preheating is not employed.\n\nOverall, AL7075 represents a remarkable aluminum alloy with superior strength, extensively utilized in industries where performance and mechanical integrity are paramount. Its ongoing study in SLM contexts emphasizes the importance of preheating techniques to enhance its manufacturability while preserving its desirable properties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 277, "prompt_tokens": 477, "total_tokens": 754, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
