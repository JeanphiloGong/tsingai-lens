This investigation aimed to analyze the implications of such preheating on the characteristics of Al7075, particularly concerning crack formation. By applying a preheating temperature of 400°C, researchers sought to understand how this thermal treatment could potentially influence the microstructural integrity and mechanical properties of the alloy during the additive manufacturing process. The insights gained from this study are important for optimizing the SLM parameters of Al7075 to minimize issues such as cracking, which can affect the quality and durability of components produced using this advanced manufacturing technique.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 331, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
