This material is particularly significant in high-temperature applications due to its unique properties. The SLM process allows for the creation of intricate components using Hastelloy X, leveraging the alloy's capabilities.\n\nHowever, Hastelloy X also presents challenges during the SLM manufacturing process. One notable issue is the tendency for crack formation, prompted by thermal stresses encountered during the laser melting process. This phenomenon has been the focus of various studies, which have sought to understand the material's behavior and properties when subjected to additive manufacturing conditions.\n\nInvestigations into Hastelloy X under SLM have included assessments of its mechanical properties and microstructure, particularly when employing preheating techniques during production. The impact of preheating is crucial as it may mitigate some of the adverse effects related to cracking. Thus, research emphasizes the need to optimize processing parameters to enhance the performance and integrity of Hastelloy X components manufactured via SLM.\n\nIn summary, Hastelloy X is extensively studied in relation to SLM due to its suitability for high-temperature environments and the challenges associated with its processing. Understanding its behavior during the SLM process is critical for developing reliable components that meet the demanding requirements of various industrial applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 370, "total_tokens": 641, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
