This specimen was manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM) techniques, characterized by the application of high laser energy without preheating. The image is indicative of the material's structural properties and reveals details pertinent to its production method, showcasing the effects of high energy input during the fabrication process. The absence of preheating during the SLM process may influence the microstructural characteristics observed in the microscopy image. Overall, Figure 5 serves as a visual representation of the specific conditions under which the Hastelloy X specimen was created, emphasizing the integral role of laser energy in shaping the material's properties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 333, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
