This alloy is particularly valued in high-stress environments, making it a popular choice in aerospace applications, gas turbines, and chemical processing industries.\n\nThe alloy's ability to maintain strength and resistance to oxidation at elevated temperatures is critical to its functionality in applications such as gas turbines, where thermal and mechanical stresses are prevalent. However, it is important to note that Hastelloy X can suffer from cracking, which is influenced by its chemical composition and the parameters used in processing methodologies, especially selective laser melting (SLM). \n\nRecent studies have focused on the microstructural characteristics of Hastelloy X when produced via SLM. Research highlights the alloy's behavior under different preheating temperatures during the SLM process, revealing the interplay between preheating effects and crack formation. These investigations demonstrate that while Hastelloy X exhibits high-temperature strength, it is notably subject to crack formation during production, particularly related to SLM processing conditions.\n\nOverall, the combination of Hastelloy X’s corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength, and the potential challenges posed during processing makes it a significant material in advanced manufacturing contexts. The ongoing research into its properties not only enhances the understanding of its behavior under various conditions but also aims to improve processing techniques to minimize issues such as cracking, thereby expanding its application range in demanding industrial environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 588, "total_tokens": 879, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
