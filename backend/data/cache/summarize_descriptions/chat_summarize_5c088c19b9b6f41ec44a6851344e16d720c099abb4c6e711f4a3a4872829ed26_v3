A specific study focused on 90mm parts made of Hastelloy X to investigate the microstructural differences arising from preheating treatments. The analysis revealed notable alterations in the microstructure correlated with the preheating process when examining these 90mm components. Furthermore, the height measurement of 90mm in the selective laser melting (SLM) Hastelloy X bars provided crucial insights into the scale at which significant microstructural changes could be observed. This research underscores the importance of understanding how different manufacturing processes, like preheating in SLM, influence the material properties of Hastelloy X, ultimately contributing to the alloy's performance in high-temperature applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
