One of the materials that can be processed with this technology is AL7075, an aluminum alloy known for its high strength and lightweight properties. Despite these advantageous characteristics, AL7075 presents challenges during the SLM process, particularly its tendency to develop cracks during production.\n\nThe investigation into the properties of AL7075 when processed through Selective Laser Melting includes an examination of preheating techniques. Preheating is employed to mitigate the cracking issues associated with the rapid cooling rates typical in the SLM process. By increasing the initial temperature of the metal powder or the build platform, it can lead to improved inter-layer adhesion and reduced thermal gradients, which are critical for the overall integrity of the printed components.\n\nThe combination of SLM and preheating strategies aims to enhance the manufacturability of AL7075, making it suitable for various applications in industries that require lightweight yet durable materials, such as aerospace and automotive engineering. This research not only contributes to understanding the mechanical properties of AL7075 when subjected to SLM but also paves the way for optimized processing parameters to harness its full potential.\n\nOverall, the synergy between Selective Laser Melting and the unique properties of AL7075, alongside the implementation of preheating, provides a comprehensive framework for advancing the application of this aluminum alloy in advanced manufacturing processes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
