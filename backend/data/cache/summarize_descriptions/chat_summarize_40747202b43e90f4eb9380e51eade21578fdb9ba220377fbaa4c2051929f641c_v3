This technique has been investigated for its significant role in influencing the microstructure and mechanical properties of various materials utilized in manufacturing. Specifically, a preheating temperature of 400°C has been experimentally studied to assess its effects on crack morphology and residual stresses in the metallurgy of SLM parts.\n\nIn the SLM method, preheating is crucial as it reduces thermal stress in materials during the additive manufacturing process. By heating the base plate to 400°C prior to SLM, researchers aim to mitigate issues such as cracking, which can negatively impact the density and overall integrity of the produced parts. The preheating process helps to ensure a more homogeneous thermal distribution, consequently enhancing the mechanical performance and microstructural characteristics of the materials being processed.\n\nOverall, preheating before the SLM process is a strategic approach employed to improve part quality, facilitate better material properties, and reduce the likelihood of defects, thereby advancing the efficiency and effectiveness of additive manufacturing techniques.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 337, "total_tokens": 563, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
