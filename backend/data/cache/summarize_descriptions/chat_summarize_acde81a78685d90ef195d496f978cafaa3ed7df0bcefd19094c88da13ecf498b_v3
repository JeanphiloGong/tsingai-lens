During the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process, H13 tool steel undergoes a phenomenon known as martensitic transformation, which significantly influences its hardness and overall performance. \n\nThe martensitic transformation is a phase change that occurs in the microstructure of H13 tool steel, leading to the formation of martensite—a hard, brittle phase that provides enhanced hardness. However, the characteristics of this transformation can vary depending on specific processing parameters used during fabrication. One critical factor influencing the martensitic transformation in H13 tool steel is the application of preheating. Preheating can alter the microstructure of the steel, enabling more uniform heating and cooling during the SLM process, which in turn affects the resultant hardness and toughness.\n\nIn conclusion, the interaction between the SLM process, martensitic transformation, and preheating is crucial in determining the final properties of H13 tool steel, highlighting the importance of precise control over these factors in the manufacturing process to achieve desirable mechanical characteristics.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
