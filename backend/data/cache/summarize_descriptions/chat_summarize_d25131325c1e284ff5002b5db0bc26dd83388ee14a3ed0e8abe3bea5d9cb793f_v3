One of the materials that has been extensively researched in conjunction with SLM is Cobalt-Chromium (CoCr). \n\nCoCr is recognized for its exceptional mechanical properties, which include high strength, excellent wear resistance, and superior corrosion resistance. These characteristics make it particularly beneficial for applications within various industrial sectors, including medical, aerospace, and automotive industries. The adoption of CoCr in SLM processes is largely due to its ability to be manufactured into complex shapes that might be unachievable with traditional subtractive methods.\n\nThe process of selective laser melting involves the layer-by-layer melting of powdered metal materials using a high-powered laser. In the case of CoCr, this process allows for precise control over the microstructure and properties of the final product. As a result, parts made from CoCr using SLM can achieve optimized mechanical properties tailored to specific applications. The ability to create intricate designs can lead to innovative solutions in fields such as dental implants and orthopedic devices where customization is essential.\n\nIn summary, Selective Laser Melting is a critical technology that leverages the unique properties of CoCr to produce high-performance components. The combination of CoCr's superior mechanical attributes and the advanced manufacturing capabilities of SLM positions both as vital elements in the evolution of modern industrial applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 287, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
