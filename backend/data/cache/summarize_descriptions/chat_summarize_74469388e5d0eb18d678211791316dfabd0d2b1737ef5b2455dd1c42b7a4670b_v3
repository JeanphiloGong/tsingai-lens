Both materials are known for their exceptional performance in environments demanding high strength and significant resistance to thermal stress, making them suitable for various high-performance applications.\n\nIn terms of their application in SLM, both Hastelloy X and H13 tool steel are analyzed regarding their part density and the phenomena of crack formation, which can occur under specific processing conditions. This focus on part density highlights the importance of achieving optimal material integrity during the additive manufacturing process, where tightly packed and dense parts are essential for operational effectiveness.\n\nHastelloy X, recognized for its corrosion resistance, high-temperature tensile strength, and oxidation resistance, is frequently employed in aerospace and chemical processing industries. Its ability to maintain mechanical properties at elevated temperatures positions it as an ideal choice for components exposed to harsh operational environments.\n\nOn the other hand, H13 tool steel is esteemed for its toughness and wear resistance, characteristics that are paramount in tooling applications. Its performance is notably effective in hot work applications, where parts undergo extreme conditions, thus benefiting from its high heat resistance and durability.\n\nIn summary, both Hastelloy X and H13 tool steel are vital materials conceived for high-performance applications within SLM frameworks, sharing common challenges and attributes related to their processing and resultant properties. Their unique strengths make them critical players in specialized fields requiring top-tier material performance under thermal and mechanical stress.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 307, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 533, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
