The alloy is particularly noted for its strength and durability when produced through selective laser melting (SLM), a manufacturing process that allows for the creation of complex geometries and structures without significant preheating.\n\nResearch on CoCr has focused on its microstructural stability and phase changes that occur at different temperatures during SLM processing. Notably, it has been determined that CoCr does not undergo significant phase transformations below 400°C, which is a critical factor influencing its stability and properties during production. The examination of CoCr in microstructural properties and phase stability without preheating highlights its robustness and adaptability in manufacturing environments.\n\nIn addition to its physical properties, CoCr exhibits corrosion resistance comparable to that of stainless steel, further enhancing its application potential in both biomedical and industrial settings. This combination of mechanical strength and resistance to environmental factors is particularly beneficial for implants and dental prosthetics, where reliability and durability are paramount.\n\nOverall, CoCr maintains a prominent position in the realm of advanced materials, where its unique properties and processing characteristics contribute significantly to the fields of aerospace and biomedical engineering. The ongoing study of its properties continues to validate its use and improve understanding of processing techniques, ensuring that CoCr remains a vital component in high-performance applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 294, "prompt_tokens": 361, "total_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
