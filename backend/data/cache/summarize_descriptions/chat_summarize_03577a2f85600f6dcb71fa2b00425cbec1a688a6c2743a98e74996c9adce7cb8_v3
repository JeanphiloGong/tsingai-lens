These characteristics include key factors such as density, strength, and toughness, which are critical in determining how a material will perform in practical applications. Additionally, mechanical properties are influenced by various manufacturing processes, including Selective Laser Melting (SLM). In the context of research, these properties are meticulously analyzed to understand how different SLM parameters can affect the overall characteristics of the materials involved. Therefore, mechanical properties not only encapsulate the intrinsic attributes of materials but also their response to specific manufacturing techniques, highlighting the significance of both material composition and production method in achieving desired performance outcomes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
