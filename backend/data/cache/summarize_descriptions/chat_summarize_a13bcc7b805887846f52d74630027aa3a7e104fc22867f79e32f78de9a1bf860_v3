This hot-work steel is distinguished by its exceptional toughness and resistance to thermal fatigue, which are crucial qualities for industrial tooling applications. H13 is often utilized in processes such as selective laser melting (SLM), a form of additive manufacturing that allows for intricate designs and efficient material usage.\n\nIn the context of SLM, H13 tool steel has been analyzed for its performance, focusing on important factors such as phase transformations and crack formation during the manufacturing process. These analyses are fundamental because they provide insights into how H13 behaves under different thermal conditions, which can influence the integrity and durability of the final product. By understanding these characteristics, engineers can better predict the performance of H13 in various applications, thereby enhancing its usability in the production of tooling and components that require high precision and resilience.\n\nOverall, H13 tool steel stands out in the field of materials for its robustness and versatility, making it a preferred choice in demanding industrial settings where resistance to wear and thermal stress is paramount.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
