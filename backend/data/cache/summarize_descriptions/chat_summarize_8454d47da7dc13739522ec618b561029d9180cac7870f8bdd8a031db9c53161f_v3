It arises due to thermal stresses during the melting and solidification processes, as well as through improper preheating techniques that fail to adequately prepare the material. This challenge is a focal point of research within SLM processes, highlighting its importance in ensuring the reliability and durability of additively manufactured components. Effective strategies to mitigate crack formation are essential for advancing material properties and enhancing the overall success of SLM technology.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
