This process operates by melting layers of powdered material—primarily metals—layer by layer, allowing for the precise fabrication of complex geometries. SLM is especially significant in the production of metallic components, including specialized medical devices made from cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys (Co–Cr–Mo), which are vital in various applications within the medical field.\n\nThis 3D printing technique represents a crucial innovation in modern engineering, enabling the development of parts that would be challenging, if not impossible, to manufacture with traditional methods. The SLM process not only facilitates the creation of high-performance metal parts but also supports rapid prototyping and customization, making it a valuable tool across different industries.\n\nThrough the layered approach of melting powder, Selective Laser Melting provides enhanced material efficiency and design flexibility, which are essential for industries that require robust, lightweight, and complex components. As a result, SLM is increasingly utilized in sectors ranging from aerospace to automotive, alongside its prominent role in medical manufacturing. Overall, SLM stands out as a key technology driving innovation in metal part fabrication, leveraging the power of laser technology to achieve superior results in additive manufacturing.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 264, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 521, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
