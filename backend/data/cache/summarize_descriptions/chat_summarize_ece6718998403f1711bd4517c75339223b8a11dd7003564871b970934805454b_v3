The data presented highlights how the preheating temperature influences the stress levels in the CoCr components, providing critical insights into the mechanical properties of these parts. By comparing the stress measurements across different preheating conditions, Figure 7 serves as an essential reference for understanding the relationship between preheating temperature and the resultant mechanical behavior of CoCr SLM parts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 295, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
