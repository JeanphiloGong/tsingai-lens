This advanced additive manufacturing technique allows for the creation of intricate geometries with high precision. Recent examinations indicate that AL7075 can be effectively processed using SLM, leading to improvements in its overall performance characteristics.\n\nOne significant advantage of utilizing selective laser melting for AL7075 is the alloy’s enhanced crack resistance, especially when the preheating method is employed prior to the SLM process. Preheating the material helps reduce thermal stresses and potential cracking during the melting and solidification stages, thus improving the integrity and durability of the resulting components.\n\nIn summary, the combination of AL7075 and selective laser melting presents a promising avenue for producing high-performance materials, characterized by superior microstructural properties and enhanced resistance to defects like cracking, which are crucial for various engineering applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 374, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
