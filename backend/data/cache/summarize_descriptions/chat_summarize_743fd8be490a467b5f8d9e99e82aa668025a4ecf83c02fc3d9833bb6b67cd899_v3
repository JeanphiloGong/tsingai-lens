The figure distinctly illustrates how these different preheating temperatures influence the distribution and magnitude of maximal principal stresses within the H13 SLM components. Each data point within Figure 6 corresponds to specific testing conditions and illustrates the relationship between the preheating temperature used during the production process and the resulting stress outcomes in the components. Overall, Figure 6 serves as a critical reference for understanding the mechanical behavior of H13 SLM parts in relation to the thermal conditions applied during manufacturing.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
