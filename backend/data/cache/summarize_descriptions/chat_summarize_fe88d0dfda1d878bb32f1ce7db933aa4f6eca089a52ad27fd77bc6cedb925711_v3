These alloys are primarily employed in dental and biomedical applications, and they are particularly valued for their strength and biocompatibility when produced through Selective Laser Melting (SLM) techniques.\n\nCoCr has been analyzed for its microstructural stability and phase changes at various temperatures during SLM processing. Research indicates that CoCr alloys maintain significant phase stability without undergoing notable transformations below 400°C, which has implications for their processing and final properties. The alloy’s resilience and structural integrity under thermal conditions make it suitable for a wide range of applications, especially in the aerospace and medical fields.\n\nThrough SLM, CoCr exhibits favorable characteristics that make it an excellent choice for creating complex geometries and tailored mechanical properties. The alloy’s high strength-to-weight ratio, along with its resistance to wear and corrosion, enhances its appeal in high-performance applications. Additionally, CoCr is recognized for combining mechanical properties similar to those of stainless steel while offering unique benefits inherent to cobalt-chromium compositions.\n\nOverall, CoCr serves as a versatile and robust material in both industrial and biomedical sectors, where demands for durability and reliability are paramount. Its ongoing analyses and enhancements in production methods aim to further optimize its applications in modern engineering and healthcare solutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 339, "total_tokens": 605, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
