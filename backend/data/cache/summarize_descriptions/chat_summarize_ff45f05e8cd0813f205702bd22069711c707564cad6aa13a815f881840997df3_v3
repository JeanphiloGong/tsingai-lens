This material, known for its excellent mechanical properties, is particularly relevant in aerospace applications, where performance and weight reduction are critical. \n\nDuring SLM processing, AL7075 exhibits a tendency to form microcracks when preheating is not applied, which can adversely affect its structural integrity. Consequently, the analysis of AL7075 in the context of SLM has focused on understanding its cracking behavior under various conditions, including different preheating temperatures. Research indicates that appropriate preheating can significantly influence the alloy’s microstructure, mitigating the cracking issues associated with the SLM process.\n\nInvestigations into AL7075 have examined its microstructural changes during SLM, revealing important insights into how variations in preheating affect the formation of cracks. The careful study of these parameters is essential to optimize the SLM process for AL7075, ensuring that the final products meet the stringent demands of aerospace engineering. The depth of this analysis highlights the critical relationship between processing conditions and material performance, reinforcing the importance of SLM as a viable manufacturing technique for advanced aluminum alloys like AL7075.\n\nIn summary, AL7075 is a pivotal material in the SLM process, with ongoing research aimed at maximizing its advantages while overcoming challenges related to crack formation.
