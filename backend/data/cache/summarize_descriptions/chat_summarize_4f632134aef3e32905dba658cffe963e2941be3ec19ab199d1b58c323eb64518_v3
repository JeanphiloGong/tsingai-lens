Mertens is an author known for his significant contributions to the study of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) processes. He has conducted research analyzing the effects of preheating within the SLM framework, which is essential for understanding how temperature management can influence the characteristics of metal products created using this advanced manufacturing technique. His work specifically addresses the implications of preheating on the properties of metals, providing valuable insights into how this factor affects the overall quality and performance of materials processed through SLM. Through his studies, R. Mertens emphasizes the critical role of preheating in optimizing the SLM process, thereby contributing to the advancement of knowledge in materials science and engineering related to additive manufacturing.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
