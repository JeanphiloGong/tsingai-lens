In the context of SLM, both materials undergo parameter optimization studies to enhance the quality of the printed parts. Specifically, H13 tool steel and AL7075 were included in a joint parameter optimization study, enabling a comparative analysis of their behavior during the SLM process. The influence of different preheating methods on their properties is a key factor in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the SLM applications for both materials. As such, understanding their unique characteristics and how they are affected by SLM parameters is critical for optimizing the printing process and achieving desired outcomes in manufacturing.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
