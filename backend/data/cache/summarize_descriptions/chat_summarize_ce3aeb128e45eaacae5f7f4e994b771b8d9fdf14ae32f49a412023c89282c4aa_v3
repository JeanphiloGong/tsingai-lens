This process is increasingly being adopted in various industrial applications due to its ability to create complex geometries that are often difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods.\n\nSLM operates by selectively melting fine metal powders, which are precisely deposited in layers. Each layer is fused together by the focused energy of the laser, resulting in a solid part. This method is particularly versatile, accommodating a range of metal materials, including alloys such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (Co–Cr–Mo), which are used in high-performance applications like medical implants and aerospace components.\n\nThe technique is not only limited to metal parts but has also been the subject of research aimed at understanding the effects of preheating on different materials within the SLM process. This research is critical as it can significantly influence the quality of the fabricated parts, including their mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy.\n\nSLM is increasingly acknowledged in the literature related to additive manufacturing, indicating its growing importance in the field. It represents a significant evolution in 3D printing technology, focused on enhancing the efficiency and capability of part production in industrial settings. Overall, Selective Laser Melting exemplifies the innovative approaches being utilized to advance manufacturing technology, particularly in sectors that require custom, reliable, and high-performance components.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 334, "total_tokens": 625, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
