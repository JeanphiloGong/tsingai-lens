The technique involves heating materials to a specific temperature before undergoing further processing, which has been shown to significantly influence the properties of the resulting parts. One specific experimental condition investigated in relation to preheating is the application of a temperature of 400°C, exploring its effects on crack morphology and residual stresses in SLM-manufactured components.\n\nBy implementing preheating, the intention is to mitigate issues associated with thermal stress during the SLM process, ultimately leading to enhanced material properties. This reduction in thermal stress is vital, as it contributes to improved part density and overall structural integrity. The preheating stage impacts the microstructural characteristics of the materials being processed, thereby affecting their mechanical performance.\n\nOverall, preheating serves as an essential technique that not only aids in minimizing cracking during the SLM process but also ensures that the resultant components exhibit superior mechanical traits and performance. The combination of controlled heating conditions and advanced processing techniques positions preheating as a valuable strategy for optimizing the outcomes in additive manufacturing through selective laser melting.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 480, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
