A study investigated the impact of preheating this alloy at a temperature of 400°C, particularly focusing on its microstructure during selective laser melting (SLM) processes. \n\nThe findings revealed that preheating Hastelloy X to 400°C has a significant influence on its grain structure, leading to a notable coarsening effect. This alteration in microstructure is crucial as it affects the overall mechanical properties and performance of the material in various high-temperature applications. The research underscored the importance of preheating in optimizing the material characteristics of Hastelloy X when processed through SLM, shedding light on the complex interplay between temperature and microstructural evolution. \n\nOverall, the examination of Hastelloy X under preheating conditions at 400°C provides valuable insights for its application in demanding environments, reinforcing its status as a reliable material in industrial sectors that require superior performance under stress and elevated temperatures.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
