Known for its strength in high-stress environments, Hastelloy X is extensively utilized in the manufacture of gas turbines, which require materials that can withstand extreme thermal and mechanical stresses.\n\nThe alloy possesses notable high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance, attributes that are crucial for its applications in demanding sectors such as aerospace and chemical processing industries. However, despite its strengths, Hastelloy X is known to be susceptible to cracking under certain conditions, particularly influenced by its chemical composition and processing parameters during Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Studies indicate that the alloy exhibits crack formation issues during the SLM process, especially when considering the effects of preheating temperatures on its microstructure and mechanical properties.\n\nResearch focused on Hastelloy X has delved into the properties of the alloy when manufactured through SLM, highlighting the challenges posed by cracks that can develop during production. These investigations provide valuable insights into the microstructural changes that occur under varying thermal conditions, which is essential for optimizing the manufacturing process and ensuring the integrity of the components made from this alloy.\n\nOverall, Hastelloy X stands out as a versatile nickel-based superalloy that combines high-temperature strength with remarkable corrosion resistance. Its applications span diverse industrial fields, and ongoing research into its behavior during SLM is vital for improving its usability and performance in high-temperature environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 637, "total_tokens": 939, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
