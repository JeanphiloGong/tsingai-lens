They have been evaluated in terms of their reaction to high-energy laser inputs, highlighting similarities in their behavior under such processing conditions. Both materials exhibit notable responses concerning crack formation during SLM, pointing to comparable treatments and results. \n\nIn their analysis, the processing of Hastelloy X and Al7075 is discussed, with a specific focus on the effects of preheating. This consideration is critical as preheating can influence the thermal behavior of the materials, potentially improving their performance and reducing the likelihood of defects during the SLM process. The interaction of laser parameters with these materials has also been studied, showing how variations in these settings affect the final properties of the parts produced. \n\nOverall, both Hastelloy X and Al7075 share common characteristics in their SLM processing, making their comparative analysis valuable for understanding material behavior in advanced manufacturing applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
