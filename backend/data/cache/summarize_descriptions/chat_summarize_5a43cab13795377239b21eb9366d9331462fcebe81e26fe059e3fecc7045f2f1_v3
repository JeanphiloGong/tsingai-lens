Both materials are subjected to high-energy laser inputs during SLM, where their processing characteristics and performance are critically evaluated. Key areas of focus in their analysis include the impact of preheating and laser parameters on the resulting properties of the final parts produced from these materials.\n\nDuring SLM processing, both Hastelloy X and Al7075 exhibit notable challenges related to crack formation, suggesting that they require similar treatment strategies to mitigate such defects. Researchers have drawn parallels between the processing behaviors of these two materials, indicating that the understanding of one can often inform the processing of the other. The effects of preheating prior to SLM are particularly significant for both materials, as it can influence the thermal gradient and cooling rates, ultimately affecting crack propensity and overall mechanical performance.\n\nThe comprehensive examination of laser parameters further highlights how variations in these settings can affect the quality of the parts made from Hastelloy X and Al7075. This analysis emphasizes the critical role that precise control over processing conditions plays in ensuring the integrity and desired characteristics of the finished products.\n\nIn summary, both Hastelloy X and Al7075 are extensively studied materials in the realm of SLM processing, with a strong focus on their performance under high-energy laser conditions, preheating effects, and crack formation tendencies. Their combined analysis provides valuable insights into optimal processing techniques that enhance the quality and reliability of components manufactured from these materials.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 248, "total_tokens": 565, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
