This concept is vital in many applications, particularly in advanced manufacturing processes such as selective laser melting, where preheating can significantly influence the material's properties and performance. \n\nThe term also describes significant phase changes within materials, exemplified by the martensitic transformation observed in H13 steel. This transformation has a profound effect on the microstructure of the steel during processing, ultimately dictating its mechanical characteristics and suitability for various applications. \n\nOverall, material transformation is crucial for understanding and optimizing the behavior of materials under different conditions, influencing choices in manufacturing, engineering, and materials science.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
