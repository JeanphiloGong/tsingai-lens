The utilization of SLM enables precise control over the material properties, allowing for the creation of parts with optimized strength and durability. \n\nResearch has been conducted on CoCr to analyze its stability and behavior under varying preheating temperatures during SLM processes. This analysis is crucial as it helps to understand how different thermal conditions can impact the quality and performance of the final product. By adjusting preheating temperatures, engineers aim to refine the SLM process, ultimately enhancing the mechanical properties of CoCr components. \n\nIn summary, CoCr, due to its favorable mechanical characteristics and adaptability through SLM technology, is gaining prominence in fields that require robust and reliable materials. The ongoing studies focusing on its processing conditions further underscore its significance in advancing material science and engineering applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 378, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
