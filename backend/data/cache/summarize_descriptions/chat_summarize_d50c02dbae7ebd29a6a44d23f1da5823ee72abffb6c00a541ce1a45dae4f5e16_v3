H13 tool steel is analyzed for changes that occur during the SLM process, which is a form of additive manufacturing that utilizes laser technology to fuse metallic powders into complex geometries layer by layer.\n\nH13 tool steel is particularly relevant in the context of SLM because it exhibits unique microstructural influences when subjected to this innovative manufacturing technique. The analysis highlights how the SLM process affects the microstructure of H13 tool steel, potentially enhancing its mechanical properties and suitability for high-performance applications. This steel is commonly utilized in tooling and manufacturing applications that benefit from the precise control offered by Selective Laser Melting.\n\nOverall, the convergence of H13 tool steel and Selective Laser Melting represents a significant area of research that explores how additive manufacturing techniques can optimize the material properties of traditional tool steels, thereby expanding their functionality and effectiveness in industrial applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
