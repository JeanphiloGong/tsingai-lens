One notable material that can be effectively manufactured using SLM is Hastelloy X, a versatile nickel-based superalloy recognized for its excellent mechanical properties and resistance to high-temperature environments. \n\nHastelloy X is particularly valued in industries that require materials to withstand extreme operational conditions, including aerospace and chemical processing. However, while SLM provides significant advantages for fabricating components from Hastelloy X, such as design flexibility and reduced lead times, it also presents challenges. Notably, the alloy is known to encounter issues like cracking during the SLM process, which can complicate the successful realization of printed components. \n\nThus, while SLM emerges as a promising method for producing Hastelloy X components, it is crucial to address and manage the specific challenges associated with the material to harness the full potential of this innovative manufacturing technique.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
