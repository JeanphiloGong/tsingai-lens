This unique structural property has been investigated under varying preheating temperatures to better understand its behavior and performance in different conditions. CoCr is widely recognized for its exceptional mechanical properties, making it an ideal candidate for various engineering applications.\n\nOne of the notable uses of CoCr is in the field of 3D printing and selective laser melting (SLM) techniques. Its strong mechanical characteristics contribute significantly to its performance in a multitude of applications, particularly in the medical device industry. Due to its biocompatibility and durability, CoCr is often employed in the manufacturing of prosthetics, dental implants, and other medical instruments that require high strength and resistance to wear.\n\nIn summary, CoCr is a versatile cobalt-chromium alloy valued for its stable FCC structure at room temperature, its examined properties at different preheating temperatures, and its significant applications in 3D printing and medical devices due to its impressive mechanical properties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 418, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
