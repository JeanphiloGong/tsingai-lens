The material has garnered significant attention in the field of additive manufacturing, particularly in Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Research on Hastelloy X during the SLM process has focused on understanding its behavior under the specific conditions of this additive manufacturing technique. One key area of investigation is the tendency of Hastelloy X to experience cracking during the SLM process, which poses challenges for its application in high-stress environments.\n\nSelective Laser Melting involves using a laser to selectively melt powder materials, layer by layer, to create complex geometries that are difficult to achieve with traditional manufacturing techniques. Hastelloy X, with its outstanding mechanical properties and resistance to oxidation and corrosion, is an ideal candidate for SLM applications, especially in industries like aerospace and power generation where components are often subjected to extreme temperatures and pressures.\n\nThe research into Hastelloy X focuses on optimizing the SLM parameters to mitigate issues like cracking, which can arise due to the rapid thermal cycles involved in the process. By addressing these challenges, it becomes possible to fully leverage the benefits of using Hastelloy X in SLM, ultimately enhancing the performance and durability of components manufactured from this alloy in demanding environments. Through continual analysis and experimentation, advancements are made to ensure that the properties of Hastelloy X are preserved during the SLM process, promoting its broader acceptance and use in critical applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 301, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 511, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}}}
